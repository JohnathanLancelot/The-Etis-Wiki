                    Ironically perhaps, Etis' most unfortunate impacts on human life continue to occur through absolutely no fault of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mimics are, contrary to popular belief, not hybrids between humans and Etis. They are <i>chimeras,</i> with some parts of their 
                    bodies containing only human DNA, while other parts contain only Etis genetic material. Their creation (altering human beings - 
                    children - using Etis DNA) is wholly illegal under international law. Despite this, during times of unrest, reports surfacing of 
                    governments, crime syndicates, and private organisations alike attempting to create these creatures for use as weapons has become 
                    all too common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process through which a mimic is created is neither simple, nor is it in any way humane. A human child between the ages of eight 
                    and twelve is required - and although the first 2-3 years involve no medical interventions, the child undergoes what can only really be 
                    described as intensive brainwashing. This is perhaps done in an attempt to pre-emptively 'tame' a mimic before it is created - but will 
                    have no impact whatsoever on the way female mimics will behave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medical interventions begin with human stem cells, modified using Etis DNA, being administered intravenously to the patient on a regular 
                    basis. The first change observed is the production of special enzymes in the saliva - also present in Etis - which have remarkable healing 
                    properties. After this, structural changes in the mimic's brain will arise, in turn affecting the mimic's behaviour. They will start to become 
                    less attentive to human speech, more fidgety, and will begin to show some 'feral' tendencies, such as occasional quadrupedal bounds and leaps, 
                    snarling, baring their teeth, climbing on furniture and up walls, and becoming predatorially fixated on live animals (including humans). While 
                    some males and some intersex individuals retain the ability to speak, all females will become nonverbal, profoundly aggressive, and virtually 
                    impossible to control. It is for this reason that the vast majority of mimics created have been males - with reports of female mimics being 
                    extremely rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mimics appear to follow the same trends as their Etis counterparts in terms of sexual dimorphism - not only in behaviour, but also in physicality. 
                    Female mimics will grow taller and stronger than male mimics, and intersex mimics will typically grow taller and stronger than males and females. 
                    Their eye colour, in the final stages of their transformation, will depend on their sex in the same way it does in Etis individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, mimics do not simply grow the tail, Etis-like eyes, several sets of enlarged canines and spurs as a result of being infused with 
                    'alien stem cells.' The truth is far less pleasant. As part of their development into a mimic, they will undergo several invasive surgeries. As a 
                    general rule, anything removed from a developing mimic will grow back in its equivalent Etis form, and so the first digits on a mimic's fingers, 
                    sections of their tailbone and spine, their eyes, some of their teeth, and sometimes even their feet and tongues will be surgically removed and 
                    allowed to reform. Removing a mimic's human tongue is a relatively new practice. We suspect the intention here is to improve communication between 
                    mimics - yet researchers in The Nest know all too well that Etis are non-social, with no spoken language. As expected, introductions between mimics 
                    almost never go well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In comparison to humans, mimics (much like Etis):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are universally more agile</li>
                    <li>Are faster on their feet (especially males)</li>
                    <li>Are often stronger</li>
                    <li>Have much faster reflexes</li>
                    <li>Can see far better in the dark</li>
                    <li>Have keener hearing</li>
                    <li>Can hold their breath for fifteen times longer</li>
                    <li>Can better tolerate heat</li>
                    <li>Heal incredibly quickly and without scarring (when able to lick their wounds)</li>
                    <li>Are far more resistant to toxins (and drugs such as anaesthetics or sedatives)</li>
                    <li>Can survive in areas with much lower oxygen levels</li>
                    <li>Can feed on insects and raw and / or rotten or diseased meat without becoming ill</li>
                    <li>Are far more resistant to disease in general</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The mechanisms behind the above traits developing in mimics aren't all fully understood, but these traits are common enough to be expected. As a result 
                    of their superior tolerance of harsh conditions, mimics frequently find themselves taken along on expeditions to explore foreign planets - and while some 
                    of these expeditions are legal and appropriate care is provided to the mimics, others involve mimics being smuggled onboard, and likely exploited. 
                    Experimentation - medical or otherwise - on mimics is also incredibly common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A mimic's transformation is irreversible, and many deaths - massacres, even - have occurred due to abuse and negligence on the part of human beings. We are 
                    right to fear mimics. Their unpredictability and violent nature is inherent to what they are (what they've been made into) but they should never be blamed 
                    for this. While controversial, a handful of sanctuaries exist on Earth to care for mimics that have been confiscated during raids or captured during riots. 
                    These charitable organisations provide a much-needed alternative to the standard practice of euthanising these mimics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is with great shame that we must acknowledge that our studies on the Etis (and the DNA samples we gathered and brought home) have ultimately led to such 
                    suffering. As researchers, we have taken this harsh lesson to heart, and have collectively implemented a ban on the transfer of any biological material from 
                    The Nest's fauna (and the fauna of any other planets we expect to study in the coming decades) to Earth. This ban is unfortunately only enforced voluntarily 
                    within our own research teams - but it is our hope that humanity as a whole will see the value in preventing further harm to human life through the creation 
                    of synthetic chimeras.
