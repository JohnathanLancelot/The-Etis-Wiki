                    Etis are estimated to live approximately 50 years - although their lifespan is greatly extended if they spend
                    significant lengths of time in torpor (it is suspected that torpor either slows or halts their aging entirely, 
                    allowing them to survive in this state possibly for hundreds of years). Below is a breakdown of their life cycle 
                    as we know it:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Females mature in their late teens, and come into heat once every five years. Males (maturing in their mid-
                                twenties) can detect a female in heat due to the scent of her blood and urine - both of which are used by 
                                Etis to mark the boundaries of their territory.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                If a female approves of an approaching male - and doesn't chase him away or hunt and kill him - they will 
                                mate. The onus is on the male to know when to retreat back to the borders of her turf, as a female's tolerance 
                                of a male's presence is typically limited, and at any point, she may turn on him and devour him, along with any 
                                young he has sired upon their birth.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Gestation takes around 20 weeks, after which the young are born deaf, blind, and completely helpless. The father, 
                                risking his own life, will return during the birthing process and take the young immediately after they are born, 
                                tucking them inside the pouches lining his abdomen and fleeing back to his own territory. Any young left behind are, 
                                without exception, eaten by the female. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The male raises his young in a nest built from the skins of prey animals. For years he will feed them, clean them, 
                                and - when they are old enough - bring them live prey for hunting practice. It has been observed that for the first three 
                                or so years of a young Etis' life, they will be fed regurgitated meat, gradually progressing to eating tougher flesh, hide, 
                                and bones.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Very young Etis all have silver eyes and furred faces, regardless of their sex, but at around the age of seven, the young Etis' 
                                faces will begin to strip away, exposing bare bone, and their eyes will begin to change colour. Males will develop red, pink, 
                                or purple eyes, while females will develop green, yellow, copper or golden eyes, and will typically already have outgrown their 
                                brothers to some extent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is at this age that a father Etis will abandon his female offspring, before they have a chance to become dangerously aggressive toward 
                                himself and their siblings. Female young will not be left just anywhere, however. Fathers are known to travel great distances to ensure that 
                                their female offspring are left in areas not yet claimed by other females, and will never leave two sisters together, or near each other. These 
                                measures are believed to greatly improve the young females' chances of survival.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Male offspring, on the other hand, will stay with their father until around ten years of age, after which they will go off on their own, or in a 
                                pair or group of brothers. Brothers who leave together will usually only remain together for a further year or so, before going their separate ways, 
                                looking for their own individual hunting grounds, and seeking out opportunities to mate and produce offspring of their own.
