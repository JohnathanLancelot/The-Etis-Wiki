                <h3>Mates & Offspring</h3>
                <p>
                    A primarily solitary species, it is uncommon for Etis to mate for life - and this occurring between Etis of opposite
                    sexes is unheard of. There have been reported cases however of male couples on occasion staying together, and one 
                    single case of an aliance (and sexual relationship) between two females. The latter is believed to be extremely rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While any Etis is a force to be reckoned with, females are notoriously more agrressive than males - so much so that
                    Etis young are never raised by the mother, but are instead taken away at birth by the father, who flees with the young 
                    tucked inside the pouches lining his abdomen. Studies on Etis behaviour have shown no signs of maternal instincts in 
                    females. Rather, infanticide is not only common but seemingly inevitable if the offspring are not removed from the 
                    mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Etis spend their first few years of life (around seven years for females and up to ten years for males) being 
                    cared for and raised by their father. Females around seven years of age will begin to develop the characteristic
                    aggression associated with adult female Etis, and so will typically be abandoned by their father at this age - 
                    likely to prevent injury to siblings, or even to the father himself. It has been noted that a male caring for multiple
                    female offspring will travel great distances to ensure his daughters are abandoned as far away from each other as 
                    possible, strategically reducing the chances of bloody conflict occuring between young female Etis, as females are known to 
                    be ruthless in defending their hunting grounds. Males, in contrast, aren't known to be nearly as territorial, and can even 
                    be somewhat nomadic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Male Etis are not typically abandoned, but will leave their father (with or without encouragement) at around ten years of
                    age. On occasion, brothers might stay together for a further year, hunting together and protecting one another, before 
                    going their separate ways.

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Because Etis are not a social species, they do not appear to have any kind of complex language. They do not write,
                    nor have studies on their vocalisations indicated that they qualify as having a 'spoken' language. Rather, a rudimentary
                    set of sounds and body language cues (primarily involving the tail) appear to be the extent of Etis' ability to communicate 
                    with one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted, however, that opportunities to observe Etis interacting with one another are so uncommon that the data 
                    available on their vocalisations and cues - along with potential meanings - is somewhat lacking. The following is a list of 
                    what is currently known:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Vocalisations</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The hum" -</b> A distorted, grinding humming sound believed to indicate pleasure, contentment or affection. Frequently 
                            heard when Etis lie down to sleep, when a father cares for his young, or during the (usually brief) periods of time when 
                            individuals are receptive to mating. It has been found in captive settings that playing recordings of this sound can help 
                            calm an agitated male Etis to some degree. On females, it can have the opposite effect if she is not 'in heat.'
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Long Whine" -</b> Similar to the piercing whine of a greyhound, this sound is only ever observed in young, adult males 
                            and adult intersex individuals. The purpose of this noise is believed to be simply to attract attention. Fathers and young use 
                            this vocalisation to find each other when separated, and male juveniles hunting together appear to use this vocalisation to keep 
                            tabs on each others' locations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Grating Breath" -</b> A raspy sound emitted by all sexes when an individual is gravely injured or frightened. It serves as 
                            a warning to others to stay away - in a similar manner to the growl of a dog. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Trill" -</b> Very similar in sound to the trill of a cat, the meaning behind the trill is hotly debated. Some studies claim 
                            it indicates contentment much like the hum, while others suggest it indicates uncertainty, discomfort, or that an individual is vying
                            for attention (the latter is often seen in young). Body language cues and especially tail movements (or lack thereof) should be taken 
                            into consideration when trying to determine what is meant by the trill. There are many adamant claims, for example, that when paired with 
                            a direct stare and an upward inflection at the end of the sound, the trill is intended as a sort of question.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div class="image-placeholder" id="tail-positions-image"></div>
                    <h4>Tail Movements / Behaviours</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>A still tail:</b> Tends to signify alertness - whether as a fear response, or due to hyperfixation (such as when about to attack prey
                            or a rival). In the latter scenario, a still tail is always paired with an intent stare and widened, darkened irises.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Slow, large sweeping movements side to side:</b> Signifies uncertainty or caution. Often seen when a male is approaching a female or
                            venturing into unfamiliar territory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Continuous, moderately fast sweeping movements side to side:</b> Can signify excitement or nervousness. Usually only seen in youth or in 
                            adults during a state of high arousal (i.e. the individual is excited or nervous enough that they cannot contain their emotions).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Sharp flick to one side (mid to tip of tail):</b> Tends to express irritation or impatience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Large, single sweep to one side (whole tail):</b> When paired with the trill with an upward inflection, and a stare, this seems to signify 
                            asking a question or asking for permission (to approach, enter another's territory, or in interactions between fathers and offspring, to
                            begin eating a provided meal).
                        </li>

                <h3>Hunting Behaviour</h3>
                <p>
                    Etis typically hunt at night, and in their native habitat will often hide in crevasses in the rock - near resources their prey relies on, such as sources
                     of water - awaiting the best time to carry out an ambush. It has been theorised that their bare, furless faces in adulthood evolved to help them better 
                     blend in with their rocky surroundings when peeking up over the edge. Once they give chase, they are incredibly fast (especially the smaller males).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adults tend to kill their prey mercifully quickly (by severing the spine at the nape of the neck with their teeth or clawed hands), whereas juveniles are 
                    more inclined to 'play' with their prey or fail to fully dispatch of it before beginning to eat it. Some individuals have been known to kill by choking prey
                    to death, although this seems to be uncommon, and is only ever observed among females.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that captive Etis behave differently from Etis found in the wild, and one example of this is the fact that captive Etis appear to retain (or 
                    regress to) their juvenile hunting and feeding behaviours. When provided with live prey, they can be incredibly cruel with it.

                <h3>Stowaway Behaviour & Torpor</h3>
                <p>
                    Etis are, of course, most famouse for sneaking undetected onto spacecraft and hitching rides to other planets where they wreck havoc for native populations. 
                    It is in the name, after all, and studies done on the ecology of Etis' origin planet suggest that this is no accident, but rather a behavioural trait that has 
                    evolved to ensure Etis' continued survival as a species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apex predators with a high (70%) hunting success rate and nothing but starvation and intraspecies conflict to keep their numbers in check, Etis have decimated 
                    local populations of their prey. With resources running low, and competition intense, a keen curiosity and an instinct to infiltrate and hide in visiting craft
                    seems an ingenious method of seeking out new territories, and new sources of food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite their size, Etis can fit into surprisingly tight spaces, and can survive for years hiding without food or water by entering a 'torpor'-like state. In 
                    this state, their breathing and heartrate can slow to the point of being undetectable, making them appear dead, and even rendering them cold to the touch and 
                    invisible to heat sensors. It is unknown exactly how much control Etis have when entering and leaving this state, but it is known that hormones are responsible 
                    for this process. In fact, scientists have been able to replicate these hormones (which only work on Etis) in a lab.
