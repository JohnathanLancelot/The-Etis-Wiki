                <h3>Mates & Offspring</h3>
                <p>
                    A primarily solitary species, it is uncommon for Etis to mate for life - and this occurring between Etis of opposite
                    sexes is unheard of. There have been reported cases however of male couples on occasion staying together, and one 
                    single case of an aliance (and sexual relationship) between two females. The latter is believed to be extremely rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While any Etis is a force to be reckoned with, females are notoriously more agrressive than males - so much so that
                    Etis young are never raised by the mother, but are instead taken away at birth by the father, who flees with the young 
                    tucked inside the pouches lining his abdomen. Studies on Etis behaviour have shown no signs of maternal instincts in 
                    females. Rather, infanticide is not only common but seemingly inevitable if the offspring are not removed from the 
                    mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Etis spend their first few years of life (around seven years for females and up to ten years for males) being 
                    cared for and raised by their father. Females around seven years of age will begin to develop the characteristic
                    aggression associated with adult female Etis, and so will typically be abandoned by their father at this age - 
                    likely to prevent injury to siblings, or even to the father himself. It has been noted that a male caring for multiple
                    female offspring will travel great distances to ensure his daughters are abandoned as far away from each other as 
                    possible, strategically reducing the chances of bloody conflict occuring between young female Etis, as females are known to 
                    be ruthless in defending their hunting grounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Male Etis are not typically abandoned, but will leave their father (with or without encouragement) at around ten years of
                    age. On occasion, brothers might stay together for a further year, hunting together and protecting one another, before 
                    going their separate ways.

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Because Etis are not a social species, they do not appear to have any kind of complex language. They do not write,
                    nor have studies on their vocalisations indicated that they qualify as having a 'spoken' language. Rather, a rudimentary
                    set of sounds and body language cues (primarily involving the tail) appear to be the extent of Etis' ability to communicate 
                    with one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted, however, that opportunities to observe Etis interacting with one another are so uncommon that the data 
                    available on their vocalisations and cues - along with potential meanings - is somewhat lacking. The following is a list of 
                    what is currently known:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The hum" -</b> A distorted, grinding humming sound believed to indicate pleasure, contentment or affection. Frequently 
                            heard when Etis lie down to sleep, when a father cares for his young, or during the (usually brief) periods of time when 
                            individuals are receptive to mating. It has been found in captive settings that playing recordings of this sound can help 
                            calm an agitated male Etis to some degree. On females, it can have the opposite effect if she is not 'in heat.'
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Long Whine" -</b> Similar to the piercing whine of a greyhound, this sound is only ever observed in young, adult males 
                            and adult intersex individuals. The purpose of this noise is believed to be simply to attract attention. Fathers and young use 
                            this vocalisation to find each other when separated, and male juveniles hunting together appear to use this vocalisation to keep 
                            tabs on each others' locations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Grating Breath" -</b> A raspy sound emitted by all sexes when an individual is gravely injured or frightened. It serves as 
                            a warning to others to stay away - in a similar manner to the growl of a dog. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>"The Trill" -</b> Very similar in sound to the trill of a cat, the meaning behind the trill is hotly debated. Some studies claim 
                            it indicates contentment much like the hum, while others suggest it indicates uncertainty, discomfort, or that an individual is vying
                            for attention (the latter is often seen in young). Body language cues and especially tail position should be taken into consideration
                            when trying to determine what is meant by the trill. There are many adamant claims, for example, that when paired with a direct stare,
                            an unmoving ('hovering') tail, and an upward inflection at the end of the sound, the trill is intended as a sort of question. While the 
                            pairing of two Etis has never been observed up close, it is suspeced that this special type of trill may be used as a way for Etis to 
                            ask for consent prior to mating.
