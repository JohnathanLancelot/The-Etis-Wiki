                    Although the Etis can now be found on various planets - courtesy of their stowaway tendencies - they are native to 
                    a small, rocky planet with a relatively thin atmosphere known as NEO-433 or "The Nest."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nest is arrid, but surface (land) temperatures are surprisingly hospitable, ranging between 5째C and 55째C. Water 
                    temperatures on the other hand, dictated by volcanic activity deep underground, can range from -10째C and 130째C. Water 
                    is notably 'heavier' on this planet than it is on Earth, but is still drinkable by humans. The air, however, does not 
                    contain enough oxygen in it to sustain human life, and so oxygen tanks are needed for human researchers on this planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lighting conditions on The Nest are quite unique, with nights lasting approximately 20-32 hours and days lasting only a 
                    few (3-15) minutes. During the 'day,' the light is quite intense, and eye damage can occur to human researchers if protective 
                    gear is not used. Curiously, while Etis have been shown to see incredibly well in the dark, The Nest is rarely completely dark 
                    - pitch darkness only lasts 2-3 hours, with the rest of the night dimly lit by the planet's four moons.

                    This rocky planet is speckled with craters of various sizes - some ancient, others formed as recently as 4000 years ago. 
                    Mountains, valleys, and intricate cave systems and crevasses give the planet an unnerving, almost veiny appearance from space. 
                    Due to the extreme risk of predation from Etis, which will not hesitate to target a human, researchers are strictly forbidden 
                    from venturing into valleys or caves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What little water exists on this planet (rain is light and infrequent - approximately occuring once a month), usually is 
                    found at the bottoms of very deep crevasses in the rock. Wells have been built around every research center, but researchers 
                    are strongly advised to bring water to this planet for their own use, and to stock up the research center's limited supplies. 
                    Lakes and ponds exist in a few, well-hidden locations, but are typically small and heavily guarded by Etis, which frequently 
                    rely on bodies of water to lure prey out of hiding.

                    It is commonly remarked, by researchers new to this planet, that The Nest looks void of life, though it takes only one night at 
                    the center for a person's mind to change. Despite the best efforts of staff, alarmingly large, yet generally harmless, insect-like 
                    life forms frequently make it into the bunkrooms. These creatures range in size from 5cm in length, to 12cm, and can flatten themselves 
                    enough to squeeze through gaps as thin as a standard pencil.

                <p>
                    Larger, furred creatures also inhabit this planet, but are extremely timid and difficult to spot. 'Eddies' are quite common - looking at 
                    first glance incredibly similar to juvenile Etis due to their grey body fur, similar body shape, and off-white furred faces (mimicing bone). Their 
                    shrill, human-like screams and piercing green eyes make them quite intimidating, but in reality they have never been known to attack a researcher. 
                    They feed exclusively on small insects and vegetation, and are believed to have evolved to mimic female Etis for their own safety. The biggest 
                    giveaway (up close) that you are looking at an Eddie and not an Etis, is their feet. Eddies have cloven feet, while Etis have almost reptillian-
                    looking back feet, and front feet that look like hands.

                    A variety of omnivorous species ranging in size from that of cats to that of medium-sized dogs can occasionally be spotted just before, just after, 
                    and during the short periods of daylight on this planet. These creatures blend incredibly well into the rocks around them - and as many have striped 
                    grey fur, many research teams collectively refer to them as 'tabbies.' They make up the bulk of the Etis' diet.

                    Flighted creatures, nicknamed 'nest bats,' dominate the skies, along with a few winged species of the insect-like group of organisms found here. 
                    Curiously though, these creatures only appear during one specific period of the day-night cycle - that is, 5 hours to 10 minutes before the light comes. 
                    Researchers have yet to determine with certainty why this is the case, but one theory suggests that it is because the flighted 'insects' carry toxins in 
                    their soft tissues; toxins which have been shown to break down rapidly when the animal is exposed to sunlight. Nest bats are immune to this toxin, and 
                    feed almost exclusively on these insects. It is possible that, even when sheltering from the light, some light gets to these insects and damages these 
                    toxins, leaving them more vulnerable to a range of other predators. Coming out after as much time as possible has passed since the last light, potentially 
                    allows these insects to build this chemical defence back up in their bodies before risking an appearance. Naturally, nest bats tend to be out and active when 
                    their primary source of food is.
