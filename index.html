                <h3>The Female Etis</h3>
                <p>
                    Significantly more lethal than their male counterparts - female Etis boast several anatomical characteristics that place them at an advantage over males.
                    These include increased height, strength and muscle tone, longer canines (all four sets), a venom (transmitted through bites) that can temporarily 
                    incapacitate a rival, and longer, sharper spurs on their backs than those present on males.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The female reproduction system in Etis is fairly similar to those of creatures on Earth who reproduce through live birth - in particular mammals.
                    A notable external feature that bears an uncanny resemblance to Earth's creatures is the presence of a belly button - albeit hidden beneath short, 
                    velvet fur. Despite similarities to mammals, Etis do not produce milk for their young, and so have no anatomical features to facilitate such a thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Etis are born fully furred (their fur colours ranging from white to dark grey), with stark silver eyes. It is around the age of seven where the fur,
                    skin and flesh on their faces will begin to flake off, eventually giving way to the exposed bone faces seen in adults. It is at this time that their eye
                    colours will begin to change as well - with females developing either green, copper, yellow, or golden eyes.

                <h3>The Male Etis</h3>
                <p>
                    Smaller and thinner - a male Etis may not appear as intimidating as a female, but they should never be underestimated as a threat to human life. They are,
                    in fact, suspected to be marginably faster than females, and can still cause an incredible amount of damage with their teeth and clawed hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Male reproductive organs are hidden internally at all times when mating isn't occurring, and so it would be impossible to tell an Etis' sex based on 
                    their external reproductive anatomy alone, if not for the 'pouches' which develop on males when they reach sexual maturity. These four pouches, found on 
                    the lower torsos of male Etis, are used to carry the extremely underdeveloped young immediately after the female gives birth to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Etis males are indistinguishable from females for the first few years of their lives, but will always grow more slowly than their sisters. At around age
                    seven, their silver baby eyes will develop into a deep red, pink, or purple hue.

                <h3>The Intersex Etis</h3>
                <p>
                    Just under 1% of Etis will develop a mix of male and female characteristics. While many of them can reproduce, no case of self-fertilisation has ever
                    been observed. Curiously, intersex individuals have often shown to be taller and stronger than females with no obvious male characteristics.
